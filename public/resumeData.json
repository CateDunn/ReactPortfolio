After working in the Human Resources realm for almost three years, I decided to take my career in a completely different direction to follow my aspiration of becoming a web developer. I hope to become a full stack developer after completion of UNC coding Bootcamp in August of 2020. Feel free to take a look around my portfolio and explore my projects.
